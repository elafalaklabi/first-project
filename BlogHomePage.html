        <p>
          Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice
          that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in
          computer science embracing cognitive science and human factors
          engineering.<q>
            HCI has expanded rapidly and steadily for three decades, attracting
            professionals from many other disciplines and incorporating diverse
            concepts and approaches.</q
          >
          To a considerable extent, HCI now aggregates a collection of
          semi-autonomous fields of research and practice in human-centered
          informatics.

        <p>
          When we’re writing HTML and CSS, we’re defining content and making
          decisions around appearance,usability, and interaction. We’re
          designing. But instead of using Photoshop or Sketch, we use a text
          editor and a browser. Our tools are different — our role is not.<q
            >Somewhere between design — a world of personas, pixels, and polish
            — and engineering — a world of logic, loops, and linux — lies
            frontend design. Frontend design involves creating the HTML, CSS,and
            presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface.</q
