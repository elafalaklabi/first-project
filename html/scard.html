      <h1>Front End Design</h1>
      <p>
        What do you call a designer who also understands front-end development?
        Many titles have been thrown around in an attempt to answer this very
        question: interaction designer,design/UI engineer (getting warmer?),
        designer-who-codes, responsive designer, ….unicorn?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, I admit, the javascript part makes me a little nervous. I know just
        enough to be dangerous. I don’t think that’s probably so unusual among
        frontend designers who have come from a design, as opposed to
        engineering, background.

        <q
          >Somewhere between design — a world of personas, pixels, and polish —
          and engineering — a world of logic, loops, and linux — lies frontend
          design. Frontend design involves creating the HTML, CSS, and
          presentational JavaScript code that makes up a user interface.</q

        When we’re writing HTML and CSS, we’re defining content and making
        decisions around appearance, usability,and interaction. We’re designing.
        But instead of using Photoshop or Sketch, we use a text editor and a
        browser.Our tools are different — our role is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because front-end dev is on the design side of our process (in the
        Kanban board and not the dev scrum) does not mean designers are now
        suddenly developers and vice versa. Of course we still need both unique
        specialties and skill sets. But, we are blurring the lines.

        In designing for the web, there’s a constant push and pull between what
        is desired and what is wise or possible. And there should be.Let a
        visual designer go crazy with giant images and fancy plugins, your
        site’s performance will be abysmal. Likewise, let a developer make all
        the choices and you’ll end up with…well, Craigslist.
