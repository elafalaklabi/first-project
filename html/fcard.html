      <h1>Human Computer interaction</h1>
      <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice
        that emerged
        <q
          >>in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer
          science embracing cognitive science and human factors engineering.</q
        >
        HCI has expanded rapidly and steadily for three decades, attracting
        professionals from many other disciplines andincorporating diverse
        concepts and approaches. To a considerable extent, HCI now aggregates a
        collection of semi-autonomous fields of research and practice in
        human-centered informatics. However, the continuing synthesis of
        disparate conceptions and approaches to science and practice in HCI has
        produced a dramatic example of how different epistemologies and
        paradigms can be reconciled and integrated in a vibrant and productive
        intellectual project.

        Until the late 1970s, the only humans who interacted with computers were
        information technology professionals and dedicated hobbyists. This
        changed disruptively with the emergence of personal computing in the
        later 1970s. Personal computing, including both personal software
        productivity applications, such as text editors and spreadsheets, and
        interactive computer games) and personal computer platforms (operating
        systems, programming languages, and hardware), made everyone in the
        world a potential computer user,and vividly highlighted the deficiencies
        of computers with respect to usability for those who wanted to use
        computers as tools.

        The challenge of personal computing became manifest at an opportune
        time. The broad project of cognitive science, which incorporated
        cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, cognitive
        anthropology,and the philosophy of mind, had formed at the end of the
        1970s. Part of the programme of cognitive science was to articulate
        systematic and scientifically informed applications to be known as
        "cognitive engineering". Thus, at just the point when personal computing
        presented the practical need for HCI, cognitive science presented
        people, concepts, skills,and a vision for addressing such needs through
        an ambitious synthesis of science and engineering. HCI was one of the
        first examples of cognitive engineering.
